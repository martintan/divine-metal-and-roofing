        <p>
          Traditional three-tab shingles were the most common asphalt roofing shingles until the 1980s. They are still
          an economical choice for homeowners who appreciate an array of color blends and easy installation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Changing tastes and technological advances took asphalt to a new level that resulted in architectural
          laminated shingles. 'Laminate' means the construction of the shingles is two or more shingles bonded or
          laminated together.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-4xl font-bold text-default self-center">Durability</h3>

        <p>
          Both traditional three-tab shingles and laminated shingles provide protection against wind blow-off and
          uplift. They guard against damage for water penetration due to wind-driven rain. The shingles offer great
          weatherability and enhanced protection against the elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Impact- and wind-resistant shingles are becoming more popular due to insurance rebates and stricter building
          codes. The latest products combat an aesthetic problem of black streaks due to algae. Algae-resistant shingles
          are coated with granules of zinc and copper that inhibit the growth of algae.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-4xl font-bold text-default self-center">Durability</h3>
        <p>
          Laminated shingles are architectural because they are engineered to create architectural interest with the
          shingles' dimensional thickness, cut, and contour. The move to architectural laminate shingles from
          traditional three-tab shingles was mainly for aesthetic purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          They simulate impressive, sought-after natural slate tiles and genuine cedar shakes without the installation,
          flammability, weight, and maintenance worries or expense associated with stone roofing and authentic wood
          materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          High definition is a term sometimes used to describe architectural laminated shingles because of the contour
          and depth of the profile of individual shingles. Manufacturers use angled and straight cuts that enhance the
          appearance and depth of a tile or shake roof.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-4xl font-bold text-default self-center">Color</h3>
        <p>
          The housing design of today focuses on gables, turrets, and steep roof planes. Random textures and colors
          accent these features. Architectural laminated shingles come in an array of colors. Those designed to mimic
          natural slate tiles and real wood shakes are limited to color blends found in nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dark and light variations of black to gray and reddish and earthy browns are used. Tones such as antique slate
          and weathered wood are top sellers. Homeowners are also choosing terra-cotta and darker green tones.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-4xl font-bold text-default self-center">Cost</h3>
        <p>
          Architectural asphalt shingles have better weather and algae-resistant properties, larger exposures, and more
          warranty options. Those features spur pros to highlight steep roofs. The shingles cost 20 to 40 percent more
          than traditional three-tab shingles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, homeowners want them. Over the past seven years, the shingles made up 70 percent of the market despite
          a not-so-great economy. People are protecting the investment in their homes. They prefer to spend more on a
          better product.
